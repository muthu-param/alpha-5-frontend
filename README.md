## A Brief of the Prototype:
  * What is your solution? and how it works.
  The idea is to create a digital identity for existing and new users.

  * Create a blockchain-based website/app that combines voter registration and  cast voting in one platform. And users would can cast their vote for a chosen party in their region, which would be securely and privately recorded on the system.

  * The website/app would need to be designed with strong security and privacy features, and  comply with relevant laws and regulations. Potential benefits include improved  security and transparency, simplified registration, and greater accessibility for voters.
